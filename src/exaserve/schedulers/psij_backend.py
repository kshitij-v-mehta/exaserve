"""ExaWorks PSI/J scheduler backend — the portable submit layer.

Uses psij-python (https://github.com/ExaWorks/psij-python) to render + submit
jobs on any scheduler PSI/J supports (PBS Pro, Slurm, LSF, Flux, Cobalt, ...),
so new sites need no hand-written backend. It is registered as the optional
``psij``/``exawork`` backend. The first production SiteProfile selects the
native PBS backend; PSI/J remains gated until its executor is qualified.

Division of labor (see doc/exawork_psij_notes.md for the friction log):
- PSI/J: job-script rendering + submission (qsub/sbatch/bsub/... quirks).
- Ours:  job *body* (identical to the native backends), site defaults
  (queue/walltime/account), and status/head-node resolution — PSI/J cannot
  report the allocated nodelist client-side, and its poller is asynchronous,
  so for PBS/Slurm we answer status with the native one-shot qstat/squeue
  helpers. Other executors fall back to PSI/J ``attach`` for state.

The rendered artifact is a self-describing script: a ``# PSIJ-SPEC: {json}``
header line carries everything ``submit()`` needs, so render and submit can
happen in different processes (eval materialize vs submit_all) and the file
stays inspectable/re-submittable.

psij-python is required only where submission happens (login node); job
scripts and compute nodes never import it.
